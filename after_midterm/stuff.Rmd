Suppose we have data $X$, a response variable $y$ and a learning rate $\lambda >0$ . We will  build a sequence of weak learners (small trees), $\hat f_b$, $b=1...B$ as follows.

  * Initialize the **residuals** $r=y$ and  the **initial model** $\hat f(x)=\bar y$. 

  * For $b=1,2,\dots,B$, 
    * Fit a weak learner $\hat f_b(x)$ to the $X$ and $r_{i-1}$ (the current response). 
    * Update $\hat f(x)$ via
    $$\hat f(x) \leftarrow \hat f(x)+\lambda \hat f_b(x)$$
    * Update the residuals
    $$r \leftarrow r-\lambda \hat f_b(X)$$

  * When done, the boosted model is:
  $$\hat f(x)=\lambda(\hat f_1(x)+\cdots+\hat f_B(x)).$$
